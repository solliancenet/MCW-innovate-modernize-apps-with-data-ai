## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 40 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided before attending the Hands-on lab.

> **Important**: Many Azure resources require unique names. Throughout these steps you will see the word "SUFFIX" as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure resources are uniquely named.

### Task 1: Create an Azure resource group using the Azure Portal

In this task, you will use the Azure Portal to create a new Azure Resource Group for this lab.

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the top-left corner of the portal, select the menu icon to display the menu.

    ![The portal menu icon is displayed.](media/portal-menu-icon.png "Menu icon")

3. In the left-hand menu, select **Resource Groups**.

4. At the top of the screen select the **Add** button.

   ![Add Resource Group Menu](media/add-resource-group-menu.png 'Resource Group Menu')

5. Create a new resource group with the name **modernize-app**, ensuring that the proper subscription and region nearest you are selected. **Please note** that currently, the only regions available for deploying to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale (Citus) deployment option are East US, East US 2, West US 2, North Central US, Canada Central, Australia East, Southeast Asia, North Europe, UK South, and West Europe. It is therefore recommended that you choose one of these regions for your resource group and all created resources. Once you have chosen a location, select **Review + Create**.

   ![Create Resource Group](media/create-resource-group.png 'Resource Group')

6. On the Summary blade, select **Create** to provision your resource group.

### Task 2: Provision Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 will be critical for several integration points throughout the hands-on lab.

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Select **+ Create a resource**, type in "storage account" in the search field, then select **Storage account** from the results.

   ![On the new resource page, Storage account is selected.](media/azure-create-storage-account-search.png 'Storage Account')

3. Select **Create** on the Storage account details page.

4. Within the **Storage account** form, complete the following:

   | Field                          | Value                                       |
   | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------  |
   | Subscription                   | _select the appropriate subscription_       |
   | Resource group                 | _select `modernize-app`_                    |
   | Storage account name           | _`modernizeappstorage#SUFFIX#`_             |
   | Location                       | _select the resource group's location_      |
   | Pricing tier                   | _select Standard_                           |
   | Account kind                   | _select StorageV2 (general purpose v2)_     |
   | Replication                    | _select Locally-redundant storage (LRS)_    |
   | Access tier                    | _select Hot_                                |

    > **Note**: Please replace the `#SUFFIX#` tag in the storage account name with a suffix you would like to use. Names of storage accounts must be globally unique.

    ![The form fields are completed with the previously described settings.](media/azure-create-storage-account-1.png 'Storage Account Settings')

    Then select **Next : Networking >**.

6. Select **Next : Advanced >**. In the Data Lake Gen2 section, enable **Hierarchical namespace**.

    ![The Hierarchical namespace option is enabled.](media/azure-create-storage-account-2.png 'Storage Account Advanced Settings')

7. Select **Review + create**. On the review screen, select **Create**.

### Task 3: Provision an IoT Hub

IoT Hub will store messages sent from IoT devices. In the hands-on lab, you will build a data generator which simulates a sensor sending messages to IoT Hub.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), type in "iot hub" in the top search menu and then select **IoT Hub** from the results.

    ![In the Services search result list, IoT Hub is selected.](media/azure-create-iot-hub-search.png 'IoT Hub')

2. Select **+ Add** on the IoT Hub page.

3. Within the **IoT hub** form, complete the following:

   | Field                          | Value                                       |
   | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------  |
   | Subscription                   | _select the appropriate subscription_       |
   | Resource group                 | _select `modernize-app`_                    |
   | Location                       | _select the resource group's location_      |
   | IoT hub name                   | _`modernize-app-iot-#SUFFIX#`_              |

   > **Note**: Please replace the `#SUFFIX#` tag in the IoT hub name with a suffix you would like to use. Names of IoT hubs must be globally unique.

   ![The form fields are completed with the previously described settings and with the Size and scale menu option selected.](media/azure-create-iot-hub-1.png 'Iot Hub Settings')

4. Select **Size and scale** from the menu. In the **Pricing and scale tier** menu, select the option **F1: Free tier**.

    > **Note**: The free tier is limited to routing 8,000 messages per day and this includes messages sent from IoT devices into IoT Hub as well as messages which IoT Hub consumers process. Throughout the course of the hands-on lab, we can expect to generate and process upwards of 3,000 messages. If you run the sensor data generator longer than five hours, you might hit the daily limit for Iot Hub's free tier. If this is a concern, choose **S1: Standard tier** instead.  The Basic tier does not include functionality which we will use during the lab, so selecting it is not recommended.

    ![The Size and scale form fields are completed with the Free tier option selected in the Pricing and scale tier menu.](media/azure-create-iot-hub-2.png 'Iot Hub Size and scale')

5. Select **Review + create**. On the review screen, select **Create**.

11. After the deployment succeeds, select the **Go to resource** button.

12. In the **Settings** section on the menu, select **Connect** and then **SSH**.  This will provide instructions on how to connect to the VM, including the IP address you will use for the connection.

    ![The example command to connect to your VM is selected.](media/azure-create-linux-vm-7.png 'Connect')

13. If you are running Windows 10 version 1709 (Fall Creators Update) or later, Windows has a built-in `ssh` command. Run the following command to ensure that your SSH key is configured correctly. Be sure to change the private key location and IP address as needed.

    `ssh -i #FILE_LOCATION#\modernize-app-vm_key.pem iotuser@#VM_IP_ADDRESS#`

    > **Important:**  If you receive an error message which includes "WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!", please ensure that you have completed the above steps and set file permissions for the private key.

    > **Note:** If you are running a version of Windows which does not include built-in SSH support, you can use an [SSH client like PuTTY](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/create-azure-vm-technical-asset#connect-to-a-linux-based-vm) to connect to your virtual machine. If you are using Linux or MacOS, you should already have the `ssh` command installed. In that case, be sure to run `chmod 400 modernize-app-vm_key.pem` to set the file as read-only and accessible only to your user account before attempting to connect.
